Who knows, maybe one of them will turn into a startup.  Below are some of these experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### End-to-End Marketplace\r\nI love markets.  Buying and selling is so much fun.  I started buying and selling at Oakland Flea market in the 90's right at the peak of Baseball card collecting. ( I just recently donated my collection to a Bay Area charity).   In the late 90's, I moved on to Ebay and reselling collectables.  I sold Star Wars action figures, sports memorabilia, and just recently moved into Hot Wheels.  Ebay hasn't really evolved much over the years and have found lots of issues with collectables ( will write a blog post on this topic soon) and thought it would be a good idea to create an end-to-end marketplace for Hot Wheels.  So check it out my first lean venture under SixLoop, [ZappcarZ.com](http://www.zappcarz.com \"ZappcarZ\"). \r\n\r\n### Coming Soon\r\nI've seen a few requests on a small service that I am working on.  No details yet but hope to have it up in a few days.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-58308331-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
