Who knows, maybe one of them will turn into a startup.  Below are some of these experiments:\r\n\r\n\r\n### End-to-End Marketplace\r\nI love markets.  Buying and selling is so much fun.  I started buying and selling baseball cards at the [Oakland Coliseum Flea Market](http://www.yelp.com/biz/west-wind-coliseum-swap-meet-oakland?osq=Coliseum+Flea+Market\") in the early 90's right around the peak of Baseball card collecting. ( I just recently donated my collection to a Bay Area charity).   In the late 90's, I moved to Ebay reselling collectables.  I sold Star Wars action figures, sports memorabilia, and just recently moved into Hot Wheels.  Ebay hasn't really evolved much over the years and have found lots of issues with the collectable market ( will write a blog post on this topic soon) and thought it would be a good idea to create an end-to-end marketplace for Hot Wheels.  So check it out my first lean venture under SixLoop, [ZappcarZ.com](http://www.zappcarz.com \"ZappcarZ\"). \r\n\r\n### Coming Soon\r\nI've seen a few requests for a small service that I am working on.  No details yet but hope to have it up in a few days.  \r\n\r\n","google":"UA-58308331-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
